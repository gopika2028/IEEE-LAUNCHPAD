### About Me
Hello, I'm Gopika Harikumar , a passionate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering .My fascination with technology drives me to understand how things work, whether it's writing efficient code or exploring new programming concept.


#### Leadership and Influence:

I have always exemplified leadership and influencing abilities in both academic and project work. As team lead for a tech-based street dog feeding system, I came up with the idea for the project, assigned responsibilities, and spearheaded the technical direction, while facilitating easy coordination and timely movement. I engage actively in peer learning by explaining difficult concepts to fellow students, which has established me as a dependable and friendly leader. My effective communication, proactive nature, and interpersonal skills have enabled me to shape my team members positively and initiate innovative solutions with real-world applicability

#### Networking:

-I think effective networking is vital for growth, collaboration, and staying current in the tech industry. I personally network with peers, mentors, and professionals on academic forums. I ensure that I engage in serious conversations, exchange knowledge, and gain insights from others' experiences. As I further enhance my abilities, I intend to engage in open-source communities, hackathons, and forums where I can learn and give back. Through knowledge sharing, mentorship, and guiding cutting-edge projects, I intend to motivate others within my discipline and promote a culture of teamwork, innovation, and ongoing learning

#### Career Plan:

-As an aspiring software engineer, my vision is to contribute towards the startup ecosystem of Kerala through the development of tech-enabled solutions with social purposes. One such project that I am going to attempt to materialize is an IoT-enabled street dog feeding system which makes use of restaurant leftovers to provide food to stray dogs. Although still a plan, the project indicates the sustainability aspect by focusing on food wastage as well as taking care of animals. Within the near future, I would wish to pilot the project locally together with civic authorities. In the long term, I would love to establish a startup that harnesses technology along with social well-being, in addition to fostering and interacting actively with the local startup ecosystem

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala is well-positioned to enhance its tech startup ecosystem, thanks to its educated workforce, strong digital infrastructure, and entrepreneurial culture. By promoting incubators, accelerators, and funding opportunities, the state can create a conducive environment for growth. Prioritizing technology solutions in essential sectors such as healthcare, tourism, and sustainability will further capitalize on its potential. Moreover, fostering innovation through mentorship, networking, and global partnerships will help startups expand and establish Kerala as a significant player in the international tech arena.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

-To date, I have not contributed to open-source projects, but I am interested in participating in the community. I will begin by contributing to ongoing projects within areas related to software development and sustainability.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I have not yet been actively participating in sites such as Stack Overflow or technical forums, but I am now looking into Discord for community participation. As I continue to build my skills, I will be joining these communities, answering questions, and engaging in discussions, particularly as I do personal projects and become more experienced

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

-I don't have any high-profile technical blog posts, articles, or video series at present, but I intend to begin creating and posting content as I become more experienced in software development.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- i have not created any technical blog posts,article, yet!
